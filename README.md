# Django Filters

A Django-based web application to manage a list of people with functionality to filter, search, and paginate through records.

Django Filters is a reusable Django application that allows developers to create user-friendly interfaces for filtering Django querysets. This application provides a powerful and flexible way to create custom filters that can be used to narrow down the results displayed on a webpage based on specific criteria defined by the user.

## Populating the Database with Fake Data

To quickly populate the database with 100 fake `Person` records, use the custom Django management command:
